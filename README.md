# Workshop Project

Small project during school's workshop. During 5 days we had to create something using the blockchain and Hyperledger. With my team we chose to do a voting app, aimed to be used in corporates.

## Hyperledger

With my team, we managed to create a simple API on hyperledger in short times but could no find out how to implement restrictions. After passing a couple of days reading the hyperledger documentation, we understood that the amount of work (configuration and implementation) in order to restrict the access on the blocks was not feasable in 5 days.

## Ionic 2

Very simple Ionic 2 project. Don't take intention to the code, The HTML and CSS code are quite ugly. In fact I used Ionic creator (a drag and drop solution that allows to generate the app source code) in order to gain some times and then did some modifications on the resulted code.
